      Hi there!
  </h1>

  <img src="file:///Users/michaelhurley/Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:200px;height:180px;">

   		<p>
      I'm  a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Kansas and a designer from the Midwest. I’ve been in love with art and design since the day I picked up my first crayon. Constantly drawing, doodling  and making things as I grew up, I always knew that I wanted to pursue a creative career. While I spend most of my days on the computer, I am passionate about finding ways to work with my hands. I’m a firm believer in the power of a strong concept with an unexpected execution.
      <br><br>
      I'm currently working with my friends at Wedge & Lever while I pursue further opportunities in the world of information architecture and experience design.
